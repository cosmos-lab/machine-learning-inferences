### Security & Privacy

* Authentication and authorization (API keys, JWT, or mTLS)
* At-rest encryption for FAISS indices and artifact storage
* Request and response redaction with PII-safe structured logging

### Data Ingestion & Governance

* Multi-format ingestion pipeline (PDF, DOCX, HTML in addition to plain text)
* Deterministic document chunking with overlap and rich metadata (source, page, section)
* Per-chunk metadata filtering (tenant isolation, document type, access control)

### Retrieval Quality

* Hybrid retrieval combining sparse (BM25) and dense embeddings
* Reranking stage using a cross-encoder or lightweight reranker
* Ground-truth driven evaluation (Recall@K, MRR, answer faithfulness)

### LLM Reliability

* Hallucination detection and citation enforcement
* Answer-with-sources instead of free-form generation
* Confidence thresholds with explicit “I don’t know” responses

### Observability

* Structured metrics (latency p95, recall@K, error rates)
* End-to-end tracing across retrieval and generation stages
* Alerting hooks for timeouts, empty retrievals, and data drift

### Scalability & Operations

* Stateless API design with externalized index and artifact storage
* Concurrency limits and backpressure handling
* Hot reload and rolling index updates without service downtime

### MLOps Depth

* Model and index version pinning with rollback support
* Dataset and embedding drift detection
* Clear separation of offline evaluation and online inference

### UX & API Design

* Versioned APIs (e.g. `/v1/ask`)
* Token-level streaming responses
* CLI or SDK for document ingestion and querying
