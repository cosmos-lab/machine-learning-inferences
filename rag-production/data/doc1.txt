[Section: Overview and Mission]
The United Nations (UN) is a global intergovernmental organization established by the signing of the UN Charter on 26 June 1945. Its articulated mission is maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among states, promoting international cooperation, and serving as a centre for harmonizing the actions of states in achieving those goals.

[Section: Structure and Membership]
The UN comprises six principal organizations: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, the Secretariat, and the Trusteeship Council. These bodies, along with several specialized and related agencies, make up the United Nations System. There are 193 member states (nearly all sovereign states) and two observer states (the Holy See and Palestine).

[Section: Locations and Offices]
The United Nations headquarters is located in New York City. Several other offices are located in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna, and The Hague.

[Section: Activities and Criticism]
The UN has primarily focused on economic and social development, including supporting decolonization efforts. The UN currently operates 11 peacekeeping missions across the Middle East, Kashmir, Cyprus, Golan Heights, Lebanon, Western Sahara, Kosovo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. The UN has been recognized as a leader in peace and human development and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It has also faced criticism for perceived ineffectiveness, bias, and corruption.

[Section: History - Background Pre-1941]
In the century prior to the UN's creation, organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross were formed. After World War I, leaders including U.S. president Woodrow Wilson advocated for a world body to guarantee peace. The League of Nations was approved and started operations on January 10, 1920, but the United States never joined. The League proved ineffective in the 1930s, failing to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1933 and the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1936. When World War II broke out in 1939, the League effectively closed down.

[Section: History - Declarations and Planning (1941-1944)]
The first step toward the UN was the Declaration of St James's Palace on June 12, 1941. The Atlantic Charter, drafted by Roosevelt and Churchill in August 1941, defined post-war goals. Roosevelt coined the term "United Nations" to describe the Allied countries. The Declaration by United Nations was drafted and signed on New Year's Day 1942 by the U.S., U.K., Soviet Union, and China, along with 22 other nations. The October 1943 Moscow Conference resulted in the Four Power Declaration on General Security, calling for a new international organization. The organization's framework was negotiated at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in September-October 1944, and finalized at the Yalta Conference in February 1945.

[Section: History - Founding (1945)]
The UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco on April 25, 1945, attended by 50 nations. The Charter of the United Nations was completed and signed on June 26, 1945. The UN officially came into existence at 20:07 UTC on October 24, 1945, after ratification by the five permanent members of the Security Council (U.S., U.K., France, Soviet Union, China) and a majority of other nations. The first meetings of the General Assembly and Security Council took place in London in January 1946.

Its mission is to advance peace, sustainable development, and human rights.

[Section: Core Programs and World Heritage]
UNESCO operates through five major program areas: education, natural sciences, social/human sciences, culture, and communication/information. Key activities include improving literacy, technical training, protecting press freedom, and preserving cultural history. UNESCO is well-known for establishing and securing World Heritage Sites of cultural and natural importance.

[Section: Governance Structure]
UNESCO is governed by the General Conference (member states meeting biannually) and an Executive Board. The Director-General serves as the chief administrator, appointed every four years. Since 1954, Executive Board members represent their respective governments rather than acting in a personal capacity.

[Section: Origins and Predecessors (1921-1945)]
The origins of UNESCO date back to a 1921 League of Nations resolution. Predecessor organizations include the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC, 1922), featuring members like Albert Einstein and Marie Curie, and the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC, 1924). The International Bureau of Education (IBE) began in 1925 and joined UNESCO in 1969.

[Section: Formal Creation and Constitution (1945-1946)]
UNESCO was formally established following the 1943 Moscow Declaration and the 1945 UN Conference in London. The Constitution was signed by 37 countries on November 16, 1945, and came into force on November 4, 1946. The first Director-General was Julian Huxley. Influential figures in its creation included Rab Butler (UK) and Blake R. Van Leer (USA).

[Section: Human Rights and Anti-Racism Initiatives]
UNESCO has a long history of working against racism, notably through the 1950 declaration by anthropologists (including Claude Lévi-Strauss) and the 1978 Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice. South Africa withdrew in 1955 over these publications but rejoined under Nelson Mandela in 1994.

[Section: Educational Milestones and Global Forums]
UNESCO's educational work includes a 1947 pilot project in Haiti and a 1949 mission to Afghanistan. Major milestones include the 1948 recommendation for universal free primary education, the 1990 Jomtien World Conference on Education for All, the 1998 World Declaration on Higher Education, and the 2000 Dakar World Education Forum.

[Section: Cultural Heritage and the Nubia Campaign]
UNESCO's cultural preservation began with the 1960 International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia (including Abu Simbel) from the Nile's rising waters. This led to the 1972 Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. The World Heritage Committee was established in 1976, listing the first sites in 1978.

In 1953, it became a permanent UN body.

[Section: Governance Structure]

UNICEF is governed by a 36-member Executive Board composed of government representatives elected by the UN Economic and Social Council for three-year terms. The Executive Board sets policy, approves programs, and oversees budgets and administrative plans. A Bureau consisting of a President and four Vice-Presidents coordinates board activities. UNICEF’s headquarters is located in New York City, where overall management and administration are conducted.

[Section: Organizational Presence and Operations]

UNICEF maintains a global operational network consisting of approximately 150 country offices, seven regional offices, and multiple headquarters and support facilities. Regional offices provide technical assistance to country programs. UNICEF’s Supply Division, based primarily in Copenhagen and New York, manages procurement and distribution of essential supplies such as vaccines, nutrition products, and emergency relief materials.

[Section: Funding Model and Financial Structure]

UNICEF relies entirely on voluntary contributions from governments, private donors, corporations, and foundations. As of 2024, UNICEF reported total income of approximately USD 8.61 billion. Public-sector partners provide the majority of funding, while private-sector contributions account for roughly one-third of annual income. UNICEF publishes financial and program data through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).

[Section: National Committees and Fundraising]

UNICEF operates through 34 independent National Committees, primarily in developed countries. These committees raise funds, advocate for children’s rights, and support UNICEF programs globally. Well-known fundraising initiatives include “Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF,” greeting card sales, corporate partnerships, and public campaigns involving sports organizations and cultural figures.

[Section: Partnerships and Sponsorships]

UNICEF collaborates with governments, corporations, sports organizations, and NGOs to support its programs.
